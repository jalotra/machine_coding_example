## What ? 
- This is a LLD question <read : machine coding> asked to me in CRED interview, the problem looks simple from outside. 
- These are the params you would be judged on : 
1. Functional Correctness !
2. Abstraction 
3. Proper Interface
4. Extensibilty 
5. Clean Code, Principles : SOLID, DRY, KISS etc 


## Why this ? 
- This repo gives a sample implementation that I did after thinking for sometime why I failed; <learn from past mistakes>
- I coded this up in python, which in itself was shitty choice, not strictly typed and people generally don't want to read it.
- There would be 2 dirs inside this, 
	- a python one, <this is what I wrote in 90 mins in interview scenario>
	- a java one, <this is what I wrote in retrospect, after reading 2 chapters of Head First Design Patterns>


Outcomes : 
1. Read "Head First Design Patterns"; It actually makes sense to me now.
2. Do and just not speak; atleast write code for 10 machine coding rounds; before you can solve the 11th one in a live coding environment.
3. Learn the langauge, my java knowledge is hand-wavy; I write code till IDE thinks it makes sense, this is not how to be as a SWE.
4. Learn what language has to offer, example know when to use a "abstract" class vs an "interface"
5. Practice more you fool.
